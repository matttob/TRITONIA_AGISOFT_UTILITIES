# This Repo will contain code and workflow methods for transforming video footage into Agisoft models

The photogrammetry workflow is based upon the Tritonia Scientific LTD Photogrammetry SOP, which has been curated from the USGS 'Processing Coastal Imagery with Agisoft Metashape Professional Edition, Version 1.6 â€” Structure From Motion Workflow Documentation'. 

The following flowchart presents a workflow to transform raw video files into models with minimal interaction with the Agiosft GUI
